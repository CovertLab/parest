priority
--------

collect/annotate all data sources

verify equations on figure 1

recolor symbols on figure 1

plot data for figure 2

separate and organize figure 3 plots

finalize data for figure 4

choose timescale, organization for plotting histograms + PRDs for figure 4

better main.py interface

structure with options for optimize

choose which files to include/exclude from repo

unify pipeline

unify ODE evaluation

ongoing
-------

repository clean-up (delete unused code)

comments

deferred
--------

faster stopping conditions with staggered perturbation size decrease, instead of exp dropoff
- will need extensive testing

review included kinetics, esp. for isozymes
- worth another pass but this is mostly done

test for hitting bounds in initialization
- easy, just run twice

interactive jupyter notebook for selecting weights
- later...

random init

profiling

selective job launching (check for output prior to scheduling)

tests
