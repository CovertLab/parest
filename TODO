flip fitting weight dropoff to a constraint weight increase
faster stopping conditions with staggered perturbation size decrease, instead of exp dropoff
- will need extensive testing
options for alternative perturbation vectors, unfit initialization
- need to add args, but is currently possible
review included kinetics, esp. for isozymes
try implementing relative enzyme concentrations
- if im willing to ignore the initialization, this is easier to implement
- unsure of how to choose overall weighting...
test for hitting bounds in initialization
- easy, just run twice
repository clean-up (delete unused code)
- ongoing
interactive jupyter notebook for selecting weights
- later...
