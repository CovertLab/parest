faster stopping conditions with staggered perturbation size decrease, instead of exp dropoff
- will need extensive testing

review included kinetics, esp. for isozymes
- worth another pass but this is mostly done

test for hitting bounds in initialization
- easy, just run twice

repository clean-up (delete unused code)
- ongoing

interactive jupyter notebook for selecting weights
- later...

random init

profiling
