flip fitting weight dropoff to a constraint weight increase

faster stopping conditions with staggered perturbation size decrease, instead of exp dropoff
- will need extensive testing

options for alternative perturbation vectors, unfit initialization
- need to add args, but is currently possible

review included kinetics, esp. for isozymes

test for hitting bounds in initialization
- easy, just run twice

repository clean-up (delete unused code)
- ongoing

interactive jupyter notebook for selecting weights
- later...

random init

post-opt data collection

parameter set filtering

profiling

alternative methods for computing the median of small sets of numbers
