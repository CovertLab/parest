@description
Every reaction has reactants and products.  Catalysts\, like enzymes\, are both
reactants and products\, but are not included here.  Standard reactions
stoichiometries should be mass-balanced\, but some alternative\,
often unbalanced stoichiometries are included because they are used in chemical
equillibrium measurements.
